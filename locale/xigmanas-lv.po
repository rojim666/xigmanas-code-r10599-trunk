"Count of reallocated sectors. When the hard drive finds a "

"drive has had to reallocate. This allows a drive with bad sectors to "
"continue operation; however, a drive which has had any reallocations at all "
"is significantly more likely to fail in the near future. While primarily "
"used as a metric of the life expectancy of the drive, this number also "
"affects performance. As the count of reallocated sectors increases, the "
"read/write speed tends to become worse because the drive head is forced to "
