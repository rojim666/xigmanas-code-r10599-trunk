============== SUMMARY =========

1. Files and directories listing.
2. Generate an XigmaNAS® ISO or IMG  file.
3. Building XigmaNAS® from the latest sources.
4. Building the kernel.

================================
1. Files and directories listing

- /xigmanas/bootloader:  This contains the FreeBSD boot loader files.
- /xigmanas/rootfs: Minimum FreeBSD root filesystem and XigmaNAS® root and WebGUI files.
- /xigmanas/svn (subversion): Contains all released files.

================================
2. Generate an XigmaNAS® ISO or IMG file

Copy make.conf to /etc.

# cp /xigmanas/svn/build/make.conf /etc

Delete all ports built without make.conf.

# pkg delete -f \*

Edit the script '/xigmanas/svn/build/make.sh' and adapt the directory
variables with your local ones.

Now install the following ports:

# cd /usr/ports/shells/bash
# make install clean

# cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade
# make install clean

# cd /usr/ports/sysutils/cdrtools
# make install clean

# cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion
# make install clean

# cd /usr/ports/devel/git
# make install clean

Start /xigmanas/svn/build/make.sh and follow the steps.

=================================
3. Building XigmaNAS® from the latest sources (normally possible with make.sh)

Here is how to build XigmaNAS® from the latest sources:

- It's really important to use only root user-account on your FreeBSD installed development system!

3.1 Update your XigmaNAS® scripts/WebGUI code with the SVN:
(this creates the svn directory)

- cd /usr/local/xigmanas
- svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/xigmanas/code/trunk svn

You should now have these directories:
/usr/local/xigmanas
/usr/local/xigmanas/svn

3.2 Update your ports collection: Git must be used to check out the ports tree. 

Install Git like this:

# cd /usr/ports/devel/git
# make install clean

If the ports tree is not available yet, Git can be installed as a package:

# pkg install git


Now Git is installed we check out a copy of the HEAD branch of the ports tree:

# git clone --depth 1 https://git.FreeBSD.org/ports.git /usr/ports


As needed, update the current ports tree after the initial Git checkout:

# git -C /usr/ports pull

3.3 Use the building script:

svn/build/make.sh

Execute all menus in '2' - Compile XigmaNAS® from Scratch' to compile your XigmaNAS® sources from scratch.
When all is done, use one of the following options:

10 - Create 'Embedded.img.xz' File. (Firmware Update)
11 - Create 'LiveUSB.img.gz MBR' File. (Rawrite to USB Key)
12 - Create 'LiveUSB.img.gz GPT' File. (Rawrite to USB Key)
13 - Create 'LiveCD' (ISO) File.
14 - Create 'LiveCD-Tin' (ISO) without 'Embedded' File.
15 - Create 'Full' (TGZ) Update File.
16 - Create All Release Files at once.

=================================
4. Building kernel

Before building the kernel it is recommended to delete the directory /usr/src completely.
Next, run the build scripts and update the kernel sources via subversion + freebsd-update.
Continue building using the 'Build kernel' menu in the build script.

Hint! 
You can create a backup from the kernel source to revert them quickly.
# cp -r /usr/src /usr/src.orig

or

# cd /usr
# tar cvfz src.tar.gz ./src

============Warning!=============
- Patches can only be applied once. 
  Multiple times will fail (e.g. when using patch command by ./make.sh file).

- If patches have been updated, the kernel sources (/usr/src) have to be
  resfreshed (e.g. via cvsup). After that apply all patches again.
